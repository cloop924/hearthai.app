            <div class="faq-a">
              No. HearThai works for complete beginners and for learners who already know a lot of words.
              Beginners can focus on basic vocabulary, simple patterns, and pronunciation. Experienced learners can
              use it to organize what they know and train recall speed.

            <div class="faq-q">Does HearThai replace textbooks or classes?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
              HearThai is designed to sit beside whatever you already use. Textbooks and classes explain ideas;
              HearThai gives you the repetition and audio you need so those ideas show up in your speech.

            <div class="faq-q">How much grammar does the app cover?</div>
            <div class="faq-a">
              HearThai includes more than 700 grammar formulas covering everyday sentence patterns, core particles,
              common aspect markers, and structures that appear frequently in real Thai. New patterns can be added
              over time without changing how the app feels.

            <div class="faq-a">
              HearThai is built primarily for iPhone and iPad users. The experience is designed around mobile use so
              you can practice listening, vocabulary, and grammar wherever you are.

              Even a few minutes a day is enough to run several vocab rounds or review a set of grammar formulas.
              You can take longer sessions when you have them, but HearThai is designed to fit into short gaps in your day.
