            <div class="faq-a">
              No. HearThai works for complete beginners and for learners who already know a lot of words.
              Beginners can focus on basic vocabulary, simple patterns, and pronunciation. Experienced learners can
              use it to organize what they know and train recall speed.

            <div class="faq-a">
              HearThai is designed to sit beside whatever you already use. Textbooks and classes explain ideas;
              HearThai gives you the repetition and audio you need so those ideas show up in your speech.

            <div class="faq-a">
              HearThai includes more than 700 grammar formulas covering everyday sentence patterns, core particles,
              common aspect markers, and structures that appear frequently in real Thai. New patterns can be added
              over time without changing how the app feels.

              HearThai is built primarily for iPhone and iPad users. The experience is designed around mobile use so
              you can practice listening, vocabulary, and grammar wherever you are.
